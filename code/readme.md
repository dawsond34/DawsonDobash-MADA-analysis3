This is Module 8, 9, and 11's exercise. 

For the exploration portion, I chose to look at Chills and Sweats, Myalgia, SUbjective Fever, Insomnia, and Diarrhea.

For our model fitting portion, the main predictor is runny nose and we explore the usage of the package tidymodels to build our models for the data set. 

This exercise is split into 5 files which are located in the code folder:
    processingscript.R is used to read in the data and clean the data.
    exploration.Rmd is used to do the exploration analysis.
    analysisscript.R is where the model fitting portion is encased in.
    analysisscript_pt2.R is where we are working with recipes, workflow, and AUC to compare models.
    analysisscript_pt3.R is looking at machine learning models like trees, lasso, and random forest.
    
The tables and figures created within the analysisscript gets put into the results folder

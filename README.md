#Overview

This is Module 8 exercise. Within this exercise we are cleaning data, doing exploration analysis, and model fitting. Our two main outcomes are body temperature and nausea. To help predict these outcomes, there are 30 variables  to use as predictors. 

For the exploration portion, I chose to look at Chills and Sweats, Myalgia, SUbjective Fever, Insomnia, and Diarrhea.

For our model fitting portion, the main predictor is runny nose and we explore the usage of the package tidymodels to build our models for the data set. 


#Setup

This exercise is split into 3 files which are located in the code folder:
    processingscript.R is used to read in the data and clean the data
    exploration.Rmd is used to do the exploration analysis
    analysisscript.R is where the model fitting portion is encased in
    
The tables and figures created within the analysisscript gets put into the results folder.

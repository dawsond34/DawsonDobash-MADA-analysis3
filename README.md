# Overview

This is Module 8, 9 and 11's exercise. Within these exercises we are cleaning data, doing exploration analysis, and model fitting. Our two main outcomes are body temperature and nausea. To help predict these outcomes, there are 30 variables  to use as predictors. 

For the exploration portion, I chose to look at Chills and Sweats, Myalgia, SUbjective Fever, Insomnia, and Diarrhea.

For our model fitting portion, the main predictor is runny nose and we explore the usage of the package tidymodels to build our models for the data set. 

The analysis part 2 portion is associated with the module 9 exercise. This is using recipes, workflow, and AUC to compare models.

The analysis part 3 portion is working on machine learning models like trees, lasso, and random forest.

# Setup

This exercise is split into 3 files which are located in the code folder:
 <br />
 <br />
    **processingscript.R** is used to read in the data and clean the data
    <br />
    **exploration.Rmd** is used to do the exploration analysis
    <br />
    **analysisscript.R** is where the model fitting portion is encased in
    <br /> 
    **analysisscript_pt2.Rmd** is module 9 exercise. This is evaluating models with Monica as contributor of Module 9 part 2.
    <br /> 
    **analysisscript_pt3.Rmd** is module 11 exercise. This is looking at machine learning techniques.
    
The tables and figures created within the analysisscript gets put into the results folder.
